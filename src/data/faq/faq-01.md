question: 'How much does interior design cost in South Africa??'
answer: "Prices for interior design services are primarily determined based on the project’s size, depth, and scope. If you don’t have available floor plans, an additional charge will be quoted to take full measurements of the house, which includes detailing doors, windows, electrical points, and built-in features. Always refer to the service’s terms and conditions for comprehensive details."
