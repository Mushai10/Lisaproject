We proudly create avante garde upcyling solutions such as glass gabion retainer or boundary walls, water features, pot pedestals and anti-erosion river gabions â€“ giving practical and visually resplendent use to a ubiquitous waste resource that government has banned from landfill and is replete in illegal dumps across the country. Our avante garde landscaping propositions are also available on a credit basis with 12 to 48 credit score linked affordable monthly repayments.'
