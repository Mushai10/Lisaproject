title: 'Your landscape specialist.'
excerpt: 'We understand the need to design landscapes that are not only totally functional, but also reflect the values, cultures, and the artistic or self-expression aspirations of their owners or primary investors. This understanding is central to how we operate, coupled with our vast experience in dealing with the full gamut of project contexts: it is who we are. Our infinite capabilities in landscape design are reinforced by over 17 years of cumulative hands – on experience, an on-going investment in original cutting edge research and the dedicated collection of knowledge, the use of state of the art technology; and also training, innovation and sustainability practices – all of which help us achieve our  goal to  deliver  forward  thinking  steeped landscapes  that  are  robust,  culturally  rich, economically  strong  and  that  proactively and  sustainably  deal  with  the  long  term  aspects of maintenance cost containment and design integrity over time.'
