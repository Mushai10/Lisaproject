excerpt: 'A beautiful garden is a vital part of your home that adds value to your property whilst providing harmonious and peaceful outdoor spaces for relaxing and entertaining.Good gardens benefit from structure, design and careful planning. Our early involvement in the design process will result in effective and imaginative solutions that are both functional and beautiful.The journey starts with a garden design consultation where we listen carefully to understand your vision, garden objectives and challenges.  Then we use this information, combined with our experience, to create a tailor-made solution.We aim to create practical, natural-looking spaces that provide interest throughout the seasons that live in harmony with the architecture of your home. Leaf colour and texture are important components in our design process, along with balance, line, proportion, negative spaces, contrast and borrowed views.Working in a variety of styles – from formal to relaxed – we use mostly Mediterranean and Indigenous plants that are cost-effective and durable.'
