excerpt: "The first step is to contact Elengecy Interiors to set up a meeting. Our bathroom remodelers will talk to you about the changes you want to make to your bathroom during our meeting, such as whether you need better accessibility or a more modern decoration?We will pay attention to your needs and offer a custom plan, including a price and a timeline, for the ideal bathroom remodeling services. Elengency will then start designing your new bathroom, which may include the expertise of our experienced architects and engineers. Following that, we'll obtain all of the appropriate permissions from the Building Department (don't panic, most of the officials at City Hall know us by name, which typically speeds up the procedure) and go to work.Before leaving you to enjoy your brand new, personalized bathroom.Throughout the planning phase, we encourage you to ask questions so that you fully understand what's going on. Your questions will be answered thoroughly since we recognize that renovating is a major job.  "
