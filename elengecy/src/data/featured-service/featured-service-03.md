excerpt: 'Bathroom renovation services are professional offerings that encompass the planning, design, and execution of bathroom remodeling projects.For a bathroom renovation you may want to change the arrangements of all the fittings and install new sanitaryware. This will mean new plumbing alterations will be required. Tiling and lighting are almost always renovated when refurbishing a bathroom, with specialist workers involved. Often new bathrooms are created during house renovations, adding an ensuite bathroom to the master bedroom or enlarging a ground floor toilet.'
